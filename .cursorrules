# Dev Dashboard - React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

## Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite 5 for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 for styling (utility-first)
- ES modules (import/export)

## React Conventions
- Functional components with hooks only
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer named exports
- Components in /src/components
- Services/API calls in /src/services
- Types in /src/types

## Styling Rules
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- No inline styles
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Dark mode by default (bg-gray-900, text-white)

## TypeScript Rules
- No 'any' types
- Define interfaces for all props and API responses
- Use type inference where obvious

## Code Style
- Destructure props in function signature
- Early returns for error/loading states
- Always include imports
- Never truncate code with comments like "// rest of code here"

## When I ask for code:
- Output complete, runnable code
- Include all imports
- Show full file contents, never summarize
- If creating new files, show the file path
